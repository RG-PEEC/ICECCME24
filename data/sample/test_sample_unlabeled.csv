I would like to learn and appreciate the arts.;autonomy;seeking cantonese speaking volunteer for community drop-in;"the grassroots, secular dtes neighbourhood house (dtesnh) aims to provide a dignified welcoming space for our neighbours to participate in various community inspired programs, as well as leadership, social, and recreational opportunities.

we are looking for 1 or 2  people with cantonese language skills to volunteer with our community drop-in (cdi) program on mondays from 9:30am-1:30pm on a weekly basis. this is an unpaid position.

about cdi:
during the community drop-in, our neighbours have the opportunity to mingle with other local residents and gain some respite from the charity model that permeates the dtes.

one of the key goals of the community drop-in is to simply animate a space that our neighbours recognize as being very much their own – it is a space that belongs to the community. as the neighbourhood house was created by local residents, we are keenly aware of the ways in which our neighbours feel most welcome in a way that “charitable” spaces often cannot. we avoid and are critical of food line-ups. food is made available and prepared freshly over the hours during which the community drop-in is open.

the food that is prepared is based on our food philosophy: it is diverse and has the ingredients listed for all to see. we avoid foods that are overly processed or high in starch, refined sugars, or sodium.

cdi is a low-barrier program in which anyone is welcome to attend, and the programs attendance reflects the diversity of the dtes community. we are specifically seeking volunteers who can conversate with community members who speak cantonese exclusively or primarily. if our team of staff and volunteers can consistently include at least 1 person who speaks cantonese, we think that will help improve the cdi program significantly.  

some of the tasks that volunteers help with are:
- assisting with making and serving oatmeal
- dish washing
- cleaning the kitchen and general spaces in the neighbourhood house
- accompanying another staff or volunteer to take the garbage and compost out at the end of the shift
- engaging with community members and contributing to creating a welcoming environment

requirements:
- understanding and support of the dtes neighbourhood house's mission and philosophies
- cantonese language skills (conversational proficiency)
- ability to work respectfully with people of diverse backgrounds and experiences 
- ability to stay until the very end of the shift to help with cleanup
- ability to work with a team and help each other
- ability to stand for periods of time (we take breaks as needed and some tasks can be done while sitting)
- commitment of volunteering once a week for at least 2 months
- informal screening call/interview/orientation with volunteer coordinator (15-30min) as part of application process.

assets:
- if you have experience working or volunteering in a kitchen, or just experience with cooking and/or cleaning in general, that is great but not really required as long as you're willing to learn!
- lived/living experience, and/or work or volunteer experience in the dtes
- ability to speak multiple languages
- sense of humour is always an asset :)

applying:
we require a minimum commitment of 2 months for this volunteer role. our application, screening and onboarding process includes:
1. email volunteer@dtesnhouse.ca letting us know which position you are applying for and give a short introduction.
2. applicants will be sent volunteer forms to fill out
3. before confirming your volunteer role, you'll have a 15-20min call with the volunteer coordinator to discuss & confirm the details of the role, make sure it's a good fit, ask any questions, and get a basic orientation before you start your first shift.

about the dtes neighbourhood house:
our mission is to provide opportunities for residents to meaningfully engage with and contribute to their community in an equitable atmosphere of sharing and learning. the secular, grassroots downtown eastside neighbourhood house (dtes nh) embraces people of all ancestries, genders, ages and descriptions; annually welcoming almost 9,000 dtes residents in a community where 70% of our neighbours have low‐incomes, 700 are homeless and 5,000 are under-housed.

those who built the dtes nh put the right to food at the heart of our work, as nutritional vulnerability was a theme familiar to all. our goal around the right to food is to reform the nutritional impact, quality, abundance and delivery of food in the dtes in consultation with residents, community food providers, non‐food community organizations, healthcare professionals, policy makers, growers/suppliers, food/beverage industry professionals and researchers. learn more about our organization & programs at dtesnhouse.ca

I would like to be disciplined, following my intentions with behavior..;competence;"Are you a persuasive storyteller? Help Oppia secure grants to support free education
          
          


Save to Favorites";"If you’re interested in grantwriting and storytelling for impact, with the aim of helping underserved children gain access to education, this is the volunteer role for you! Oppia is looking for passionate individuals to join our Grants and Fundraising Team to help secure the financial sustainability of the organization and enable Oppia to continue providing free educational services for underserved learners around the world who are unable to afford them.  To get started, please fill in this form:  https://forms.gle/5hwbq9c6AUYdzFqh7Who We Are The Oppia Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the mission to provide high quality education to all. We do this through the creation and maintenance of our free-to-use platform, Oppia (https://www.oppia.org), the coordination of our passionate contributors, and the development of critical partnerships with NGOs in the communities we aim to serve.Where You Fit In Millions of children are not receiving the education they deserve. Of the 61 million children worldwide who cannot attend primary school, 17 million will never step foot into a school if trends continue. In the wake of COVID-19, millions more children are also seeing interruptions in their daily lives, stability, and education - making it even more difficult than before for many students to get the education they need to succeed. The learners we serve are typically from low-income families which cannot afford to pay for education; in some cases, the parents may not even have had the opportunity to attend school. Thus, to maintain and improve the services that we offer to them, it is important to source funding that allows us to cover the cost of offering these services. We generally aim to fund operating expenses through individual donations, but there are several major projects we are undertaking (such as core improvements to the website and Android app based on feedback from learners and volunteers) that will require grant funding in order to succeed. We are currently seeking strong writers who can help with grant and funding applications. This process includes helping to collate impact stories and metrics, describing the organization’s current and proposed activities in a clear and readable way, and compiling the application material for specific grants. We welcome individuals who are willing to learn and grow through this opportunity, and would be happy to guide those without prior experience in grant writing.Why Oppia is an Organization You Want to Work With Oppia has served over 2,000,000 users.

Save to FavoritesIf you’re interested in grantwriting and storytelling for impact, with the aim of helping underserved children gain access to education, this is the volunteer role for you! Oppia is looking for passionate individuals to join our Grants and Fundraising Team to help secure the financial sustainability of the organization and enable Oppia to continue providing free educational services for underserved learners around the world who are unable to afford them.  To get started, please fill in this form:  https://forms.gle/5hwbq9c6AUYdzFqh7Who We Are The Oppia Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with the mission to provide high quality education to all. We do this through the creation and maintenance of our free-to-use platform, Oppia (https://www.oppia.org), the coordination of our passionate contributors, and the development of critical partnerships with NGOs in the communities we aim to serve.Where You Fit In Millions of children are not receiving the education they deserve. Of the 61 million children worldwide who cannot attend primary school, 17 million will never step foot into a school if trends continue. In the wake of COVID-19, millions more children are also seeing interruptions in their daily lives, stability, and education - making it even more difficult than before for many students to get the education they need to succeed. The learners we serve are typically from low-income families which cannot afford to pay for education; in some cases, the parents may not even have had the opportunity to attend school. Thus, to maintain and improve the services that we offer to them, it is important to source funding that allows us to cover the cost of offering these services. We generally aim to fund operating expenses through individual donations, but there are several major projects we are undertaking (such as core improvements to the website and Android app based on feedback from learners and volunteers) that will require grant funding in order to succeed. We are currently seeking strong writers who can help with grant and funding applications. This process includes helping to collate impact stories and metrics, describing the organization’s current and proposed activities in a clear and readable way, and compiling the application material for specific grants. We welcome individuals who are willing to learn and grow through this opportunity, and would be happy to guide those without prior experience in grant writing.Why Oppia is an Organization You Want to Work With Oppia has served over 2,000,000 users.

I would like to be logical, rational..;competence;Volunteering project in Italy – La Finestra/ La Polha;"Activity description
        The ESC project concerns two areas: disability and the promotion of volunteering among young people.
These two associations (la Finestra and Polha) work with disabled people. The volunteer will be active in both associations: at Polha he/she will support disabled people during the training of different sports (hand-bike, sledge hockey, swimming and table tennis), while at La Finestra he/she will be involved in different workshops such as artistic, manual writing, dancing and more. We have chosen two local associations that work with disabled people to allow the volunteers to experience different realities.
The European volunteer supports the team of these associations for about 25 hours a week (50% in La Finestra and 50 % in Polha) and the team of CSV for about 10 hours per month. 
At the CSV the volunteer will be mainly involved in actions related to young people (promotion of volunteering in schools, planning of youth events ...), and the contribution will be peer-to-peer.                    Accommodation, food and transport arrangements
        Volunteers are hosted in Casa Grizzetti: a fully equipped house, with two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. The house has also a garden. The volunteer will share a bedroom with another volunteer. The house is in the small town of Malnate, a 15-minute walk from the train station. By train, you can reach Varese in 5 minutes and Milano in 45 minutes. Volunteers will cook for themselves. For those who work at La Finestra lunch is provided by the centre.                    Training during the activity
        On-arrival training is provided by coordinating organisations about the project aims and the overall community partnerships. Volunteers will also be given all the instructions regarding ESC principles and functioning in our organisation. Training on working with young people, in the cultural field and training on using communication tools will be provided by the staff of the organisations. Volunteers will be given informal learning process support through active participation in monthly group training on the YOUTH PASS certificate.                    Participant profile
        All people aged 18 - 30, who have a genuine interest and passion for working with people with disabilities and sports activities. No professional skills and experience are required, however, it is recommended that volunteers have experience in a similar sector or provide support in their personal life to have a realistic idea of working with disabled people. As we work with vulnerable adults, the volunteers should be kind, patient and compassionate. Volunteers who are willing to share their hobbies and interests (such as arts and sports) are welcome.";Soziales und Gesundheit;Arbeit mit behinderten Menschen;EU;"I would like to be logical, rational..Volunteering project in Italy – La Finestra/ La PolhaActivity description
