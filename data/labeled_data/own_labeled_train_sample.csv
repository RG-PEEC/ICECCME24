        The primary objective of the project is to foster the participation of children and young individuals in community affairs while supporting endeavors that advance active citizenship, sustainable development, and non-formal education.The initiative engages 12 ESC volunteers,  who will assist in facilitating community mini-projects initiated voluntarily by children and young people, with guidance from the ESC volunteers.Recognizing the significance of civic engagement among children and youth within their communities, the project seeks to nurture their development as future adults while also contributing to the broader societal fabric, which often grapples with passivity and a dearth of civic involvement.The project operates on the premise that active participation is best cultivated through practical engagement rather than mere instruction in norms and rules.

        We are looking for volunteers!!! :) VESSEL - Volunteering as an Engine for Solidarity, Social Engagement and Learning opportunities is a volunteering activity involving several volunteers from different countries, divided by different time periods. The volunteers will be placed for 6 months in Olhão, where they'll have the opportunity to experience a totally different culture and way of living, to learn and experience new things, and to use the knowledge and experience gained in their countries so that they can act as a liaison between partner organizations. The volunteers will be involved in the activities and projects developed by the Host Organisation and will be encouraged to develop and implement their own projects/ideas. At the moment, we have 2 different spaces based inside of neighborhoods, where volunteers will be working with kids and teenagers, helping them with homework, and providing a different set of sessions/workshops on a daily basis.                    Accommodation, food and transport arrangements
        The volunteer will live in a furnished rented flat shared with other volunteers, close to the office and not far from the centre of the town. The flat contains all the necessary amenities and is divided in different rooms, kitchen, and bathroom(s). The volunteers will have their own bedroom or share it with another volunteer, a shared kitchen and bathroom(s). A monthly contribution for food will be given to every volunteer. The volunteers will receive a monthly pocket money as stipulated by the European Solidarity Corps. This amounts will be payed in the beginning of every month.                    Training during the activity
        On-arrival and mid-term training's will be provided by the Portuguese National Agency for Erasmus+ Youth in Action Programme. OLS will be the official tool to use to learn Portuguese during the Project. Since the project activities require work and communication with other people, it is necessary and important that the volunteers try to speak in order to perform their duties. For that purpose, there will be 3 hours of Portuguese Lessons per week.                    Participant profile
        The volunteer’s selection process is intended to be transparent and open to all involved. There are no preferences regarding gender, age, or study areas. However, a special concern is taken on the analysis of volunteers’ expressed interest in working with children and young people with fewer opportunities and at risk of exclusion, since these will be the main goal of the proposed activities. The fact that the volunteer has some experience linked with youth associations is seen as positive for the development of the activities/projects, but it will not be an exclusion point for the decision.";Soziales und Gesundheit;Arbeit mit Kindern und Jugendlichen;EU;0.0

        Youth for Community Empowerment is a volunteer project that involves volunteers aged between 18 and 30, residing in EU countries
Its main goal is to match international volunteering with the empowerment of the local community in which the volunteers will live in.

The project is configured as an opportunity for discussion, exchange and growth both for the four hosted volunteers and the local community, not intended only as a physical and figurative place of hosting, but as an ""educating"" community that contributes to the development of skills and knowledge of all participants in the project. The local community also benefits from the meeting and cooperation with young European volunteers.

The volunteers will take part in the activities, mostly the ones with children and youngsters                    Accommodation, food and transport arrangements

The flat is fully furnished, with fast wi-fi connection, two bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, common room and a small balcony, and equipped. The volunteers will receive a monthly allowance for their meals, beside a pocket money for their personal expenses. 
The volunteers will also receive a bicycle to ease their movements across the town and to the venues where the activities take place.                    Training during the activity
        During the project the volunteers will be supported by a tutor and a mentor, that will ease their learning process.

Having a good job..;competence;BLUE HORIZON;"Activity description
        The primary objective of the project is to foster the participation of children and young individuals in community affairs while supporting endeavors that advance active citizenship, sustainable development, and non-formal education.The initiative engages 12 ESC volunteers,  who will assist in facilitating community mini-projects initiated voluntarily by children and young people, with guidance from the ESC volunteers.Recognizing the significance of civic engagement among children and youth within their communities, the project seeks to nurture their development as future adults while also contributing to the broader societal fabric, which often grapples with passivity and a dearth of civic involvement.The project operates on the premise that active participation is best cultivated through practical engagement rather than mere instruction in norms and rules. Thus, the emphasis is on hands-on involvement within the community.

        We are looking for our new team of mushroom lovers, who will work in this circular economy project called Café Vert! This project started years ago, with formation and lots of experimentation, and since 2020, our ESC volunteers are part of this experience. Our cooperative IDC's projects aim to raise awareness about the actual context we are living and to propose and create solutions to be part of a positive change in a social, cultural and environmental aspect. In this project especifically, we will reuse waste to create new life. We collect coffee waste from cafés and restaurants and we mix it with mycellieum to grow oyster mushrooms. And after harvesting, we use that new “waste” in our earth-worm farm, which is great to create new and rich soil for plants.

Growing outside can be related to gardening, relationships, nature, or our skills. Perma comes from permanent –something that can be sustainable.

Vegetables, herbs, and fruits are grown and processed organically. Free Farm aims to raise awareness of biodynamic farming and the role of a farmer nowadays. The goal of the project is to connect people from different countries and experience the operation of a Czech organic farm, develop a tolerant open society and acquire a responsible approach to the world. 
Your work will mainly consist of manual farm work of all kinds. These include weeding, planting, hoeing, harvesting, watering, cleaning and storing vegetables, etc. In addition to vegetables, there are medical herbs grown, which you can also help to collect and process. You might also do gardening work and help out with the maintenance of the farm.                    Accommodation, food and transport arrangements
        Accommodation is provided directly at the farm. You will sleep in the attic on mattresses in a renovated historic farmhouse. Bring your sleeping bag! There are two showers with hot water, two toilets, a common room, and a kitchen available. There is WIFI and a washing machine. You will prepare breakfast and dinner together as a group. Lunch will be prepared by the members of the community, you will eat all together with the community. The local project partner will provide ingredients, including local organic vegetables. Meals will be mostly vegetarian.                    Training during the activity
        You will learn about the Camphill movement, living in a community, and organic and biodynamic agriculture. Together you will talk about Czech, European and each other’s cultures and various related topics. There is also the possibility to organise workshops focused on eurythmy and intuitive pedagogy. The volunteers are encouraged to organise an international evening for community members on their own initiative and present their national cuisine and culture. Bring your favourite recipes and some specific ingredients if needed.                    Participant profile
        The project is mainly suitable for people who are interested in farming and community life and don’t mind working from early hours.

        GAIA runs a permaculture program in Bozevce village, which serves as a polygon for natural building, permaculture, community living and sustainable practices. We nurture relations with neighbors and other villages, local food procedures, local institutions, etc. Our project proves that it is possible that people from different cultures, backgrounds, ethnicities, ages can live and work together, and that life in a village can be a right choice :)
Through the years, we have hosted dozens of trainings, workshops and gatherings, and got support from many local and international volunteers, friends and travelers. With all of them, we tackled different environmental and social topics, shared knowledge and skills, and incorporated different solutions into our design and programs.
The main activities will be around building an outdoor kitchen/dining space, which will be built of wooden and earthen items, using traditional techniques and mainly hand tools.                    Accommodation, food and transport arrangements
        The volunteers will stay in a house with 4 rooms, a small kitchen, 1 shower and outdoor composting toilet. There are several other composting toilets and outdoor showers as well. Volunteers should bring their sleeping bags and towels and we will provide sheets and pillows. Cooking and cleaning will be done in teams and food will be vegetarian, seasonal, local, healthy, and very tasty.
On the property we also live together with several dogs, cats, goats, chickens, geese and bees.
Lifestyle is sustainable, simple, and without much technology, even though access to the internet is available.                    Training during the activity
        There will be many different learning opportunities for the participants:
- Basics of woodwork
- Traditional crafts
- Cob as a building material 
- Earthen plaster
- History of natural building and different techniques
- Learning and practicing Safety on working site and working with tools
