# ICECCME24 Project

Welcome to the ICECCME24 project repository. This repository contains the code and related materials for the research paper presented at the International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME 2024).

The project aims to synergistically align volunteers' personal goals with volunteering opportunities using a recommender system based on customized cross-encoder models. The contributions of the project are threefold:

Utilizing large language models (LLMs) to provide labeled ground truth data for personal goals and volunteering opportunities.
Developing a learning approach for fine-tuned models using transfer learning based on cross-encoder models.
Evaluating the feasibility of different labeling approaches and the resulting models based on appropriate metrics and statistical tests.

# Introduction

Volunteering is a powerful catalyst for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by fostering inclusive participation and grassroots action. This project addresses the sustainability challenges of the voluntary sector, focusing on goal-oriented volunteering where personal goals of volunteers are aligned with volunteering opportunities. The proposed solution involves a recommender system utilizing customized cross-encoder models and transfer learning.
